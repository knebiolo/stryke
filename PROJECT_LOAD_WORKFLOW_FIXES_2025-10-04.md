# Project Load Workflow Fixes - October 4, 2025 (Part 3)

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Auto-Save Restore Dialog Overwriting Loaded Project Data ‚úÖ

**Problem:** 
When loading a .stryke project file:
1. Project loads and writes CSV files
2. User is redirected to create_project page
3. Auto-save detects old form data in localStorage
4. Shows "Restore from X minutes ago?" dialog
5. If user clicks "Restore", it overwrites the loaded project data with blank/old auto-save data
6. Form fields appear empty even though project loaded successfully

**Root Cause:**
- Auto-save localStorage persists across sessions
- Load project didn't clear localStorage
- Auto-save prompt appeared on every page navigation after load
- Clicking "Restore" replaced loaded CSV data with stale localStorage data

**Solution:**
1. Added `project_loaded` flag to session when .stryke file is loaded
2. Added inline script to clear localStorage on all pages when `project_loaded=True`
3. Changed auto-save threshold from 1 minute to 3 minutes (already fixed earlier)

**Code Changes:**

`app.py - load_project()`:
```python
# Set flag that project was loaded
session['project_loaded'] = True

# Clear auto-save since we just loaded a project
flash('‚úÖ Project loaded successfully! All data has been restored. Click "Next Page" to continue.')
```

`create_project.html` (and all other page templates):
```html
{% if project_loaded %}
<script>
    // Clear auto-save when viewing loaded project
    localStorage.removeItem('stryke_autosave');
    localStorage.removeItem('stryke_autosave_timestamp');
</script>
{% endif %}
```

### Issue 2: "Create Project" Button Should Become "Next Page" When Loaded ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- After loading a project, user sees "Create Project" button
- This is confusing - project already exists
- User expects "Next Page" navigation button instead
- All "Save" buttons should be hidden/replaced with "Next Page" buttons

**Solution:**
- Changed all form submit buttons to conditionally show:
  - When `project_loaded=False`: Show "Save" button (normal workflow)
  - When `project_loaded=True`: Show "Next Page ‚Üí" button (loaded project workflow)
- "Next Page" buttons navigate directly without form submission

**Code Changes:**

`create_project.html`:
```html
{% if project_loaded %}
<button type="button" onclick="window.location.href='{{ url_for('flow_scenarios') }}'">Next Page ‚Üí</button>
{% else %}
<button type="submit">Create Project</button>
{% endif %}
```

Applied to all pages:
- `create_project.html` ‚Üí Next: flow_scenarios
- `flow_scenarios.html` ‚Üí Next: facilities
- `facilities.html` ‚Üí Next: unit_parameters
- `unit_parameters.html` ‚Üí Next: graph_editor
- `graph_editor.html` ‚Üí Next: population
- (population and operating_scenarios navigate via existing links)

### Issue 3: Form Fields Appear Blank After Loading Project ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- `.stryke` file loads successfully (CSV files written to disk)
- Session variables populated
- But form fields show blank on all pages
- User can't see the loaded data

**Root Causes:**
1. `create_project` route was passing data to template ‚úì (already working)
2. `flow_scenarios` route was passing data to template ‚úì (already working)
3. `facilities` route was NOT reading from CSV or passing data to template ‚úó
4. `unit_parameters` route was NOT passing context variables ‚úó
5. `population` route needs to load from CSV ‚úó
6. `operating_scenarios` route needs to load from CSV ‚úó

**Solution:**
Fixed all routes to pass `project_loaded` flag and load existing data from CSV files.

**Code Changes:**

All routes now follow this pattern:
```python
@app.route('/some_page', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def some_page():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Handle form submission
        session['project_loaded'] = False  # Clear flag when creating new data
        # ... save data ...
    
    # GET request - load existing data and pass project_loaded flag
    project_loaded = session.get('project_loaded', False)
    # ... load data from CSV if exists ...
    return render_template('some_page.html', project_loaded=project_loaded, **data)
```

### Issue 4: Clear project_loaded Flag When Creating New Project ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- If user loads a project, then creates a new project, the `project_loaded` flag stays `True`
- "Next Page" buttons remain instead of "Save" buttons
- User can't save new data

**Solution:**
Added `session['project_loaded'] = False` when creating new project in `create_project` POST handler.

```python
# Clear project_loaded flag since we're creating a new project
session['project_loaded'] = False
```

## Files Modified

### Backend (app.py)
1. `load_project()` - Added `session['project_loaded'] = True`
2. `create_project()` POST - Added `session['project_loaded'] = False`
3. `create_project()` GET - Pass `project_loaded` flag
4. `flow_scenarios()` GET - Pass `project_loaded` flag
5. `facilities()` GET - Pass `project_loaded` flag
6. `unit_parameters()` GET - Pass `project_loaded` flag + context vars
7. `graph_editor()` GET - Pass `project_loaded` flag + graph_data
8. `population()` GET - Pass `project_loaded` flag
9. `operating_scenarios()` GET - Pass `project_loaded` flag

### Templates
1. `create_project.html` - Conditional button, localStorage clear script
2. `flow_scenarios.html` - Conditional button, localStorage clear script
3. `facilities.html` - Conditional button, localStorage clear script
4. `unit_parameters.html` - Conditional button, localStorage clear script
5. `graph_editor.html` - Conditional button, localStorage clear script

## Workflow Comparison

### Before Fix:
1. User loads .stryke file
2. Redirected to create_project page
3. "Restore from 2 minutes ago?" dialog appears üî¥
4. User clicks "Restore" (thinking it will restore the project) üî¥
5. Auto-save data (blank/old) replaces loaded project data üî¥
6. Form fields are blank üî¥
7. User sees "Create Project" button üî¥
8. Confused - did project load? üî¥

### After Fix:
1. User loads .stryke file
2. localStorage cleared automatically ‚úÖ
3. Redirected to create_project page
4. Form fields populated with loaded data ‚úÖ
5. Message: "Project loaded successfully! Click Next Page to continue" ‚úÖ
6. "Next Page ‚Üí" button visible ‚úÖ
7. No auto-save restore dialog ‚úÖ
8. Click "Next Page" ‚Üí flow_scenarios page
9. Form fields populated ‚úÖ
10. "Next Page ‚Üí" button visible ‚úÖ
11. Navigate through all pages reviewing loaded data
12. "Save Project" buttons still available on all pages

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load .stryke file from create_project page
- [ ] Verify no "Restore" dialog appears
- [ ] Verify create_project fields are populated
- [ ] Verify "Next Page ‚Üí" button shows instead of "Create Project"
- [ ] Click "Next Page" ‚Üí flow_scenarios
- [ ] Verify flow_scenarios fields are populated
- [ ] Verify "Next Page ‚Üí" button shows instead of "Save Flow Scenario"
- [ ] Click "Next Page" ‚Üí facilities
- [ ] Verify facilities data is loaded
- [ ] Verify "Next Page ‚Üí" button shows instead of "Save Facilities"
- [ ] Continue through all pages (unit_parameters, graph_editor, population, operating_scenarios)
- [ ] Verify "Save Project" button works on all pages
- [ ] Create a NEW project (click home, login again)
- [ ] Verify "Create Project" button shows (not "Next Page")
- [ ] Verify "Save" buttons show (not "Next Page")

## Known Limitations

### Facilities Data Display
The facilities page dynamically generates form fields based on `num_facilities`. When a project is loaded:
- The CSV data is restored ‚úÖ
- Session variables are set ‚úÖ
- Template receives `project_loaded=True` ‚úÖ
- BUT: The JavaScript `generateFacilityForms()` needs to read from the CSV to populate the dynamic forms

**TODO:** Update `facilities.html` JavaScript to:
1. Fetch facilities data from server when page loads
2. Populate dynamic form fields with loaded data
3. This requires an API endpoint like `/get_facilities_data`

### Population & Operating Scenarios
Similar to facilities, these pages have complex forms that need additional work:
- CSV data is loaded ‚úÖ
- `project_loaded` flag is passed ‚úÖ
- But forms need JavaScript to fetch and populate data

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Create `/get_population_data` endpoint
2. Create `/get_operating_scenarios_data` endpoint
3. Update page JavaScript to fetch and populate on load

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Indicator:** Add a banner at top of page when `project_loaded=True`:
   ```html
   <div style="background: #d4edda; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #28a745;">
       üìÇ Viewing Loaded Project: <strong>{{ project_name }}</strong>
       <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}" style="float: right;">Start New Project</a>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Disable Form Fields:** When `project_loaded=True`, make fields readonly:
   ```html
   <input type="text" name="project_name" value="{{ project_name }}" {% if project_loaded %}readonly{% endif %}>
   ```

3. **Edit Mode Toggle:** Add "Edit Mode" button to allow modifying loaded project:
   ```html
   {% if project_loaded %}
   <button onclick="enableEdit()">‚úèÔ∏è Edit Mode</button>
   {% endif %}
   ```

4. **Progress Indicator:** Show which page user is on:
   ```
   Create Project ‚Üí Flow Scenarios ‚Üí Facilities ‚Üí Unit Parameters ‚Üí Graph ‚Üí Population ‚Üí Operating Scenarios ‚Üí Model Summary
         ‚úì              ‚úì              ‚ñ∂           ...           ...        ...             ...                  ...
   ```

5. **Validation Skip:** When navigating with "Next Page", skip form validation since data already validated when saved
