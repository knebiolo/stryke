# Full Project Save/Load Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Feature #1: Full Project Save/Load - COMPLETE**

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Backend Routes** (`webapp/app.py`)
   
   **`/save_project` (POST)**
   - Gathers ALL session data from user's folder
   - Packages into single JSON structure
   - Downloads as `.stryke` file to browser Downloads folder
   - Filename format: `{project_name}_{timestamp}.stryke`
   
   **`/load_project` (POST)**
   - Accepts uploaded `.stryke` file
   - Validates JSON structure and version
   - Clears existing session data
   - Restores all project files to session folder
   - Redirects to create_project page to show loaded data

2. **Data Included in Project File:**
   
   **Complete Project State:**
   - ✅ Project Info (name, notes, units, model setup)
   - ✅ Flow Scenarios (static or hydrograph)
   - ✅ Hydrograph Data (if applicable)
   - ✅ Facilities (names, units, flows, operations)
   - ✅ Unit Parameters (turbine specs, all units)
   - ✅ Graph/Routing Network (nodes, edges, connections)
   - ✅ Population Data (species, distributions)
   - ✅ Operating Scenarios (seasonal operations)
   
   **Metadata:**
   - Version number (for future compatibility)
   - Save timestamp
   - Project name (used for filename)

3. **User Interface Enhancements:**

   **Home Page (index.html):**
   - 📁 Project Management section with blue box styling
   - ➕ "Create New Project" button (green)
   - 📂 "Load Project" button (file picker, auto-submit)
   - 💾 "Save Current Project" button (yellow)
   - Helpful tip about saving/sharing projects

   **Create Project Page:**
   - 💾 Save/Load section at bottom
   - Compact two-button layout
   - Tips about .stryke file format

   **Model Summary Page:**
   - 💾 "Save Your Project" section before Run Simulation
   - Prominent yellow button
   - Reminder to save before running simulation
   - Description of what gets saved

4. **File Format:**

   **`.stryke` File Structure (JSON):**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "saved_date": "2025-01-04T14:30:00",
     "project_info": [...],
     "flow_scenarios": [...],
     "hydrograph": [...],
     "facilities": [...],
     "unit_parameters": {
       "csv_content": "..."
     },
     "graph": {...},
     "population": [...],
     "operating_scenarios": [...]
   }
   ```

### How It Works:

**Saving a Project:**
1. User clicks "💾 Save Project" button
2. Backend collects all CSV and JSON files from session folder
3. Converts to unified JSON structure
4. Downloads as `.stryke` file to Downloads folder
5. Flash message: "✅ Project saved successfully!"

**Loading a Project:**
1. User clicks "📂 Load Project" → File picker opens
2. User selects `.stryke` file from anywhere on computer
3. Form auto-submits on file selection
4. Backend validates file format
5. Clears existing session data
6. Restores all files to session folder
7. Flash message: "✅ Project loaded successfully! All data has been restored."
8. Redirects to Create Project page

**Validation:**
- Checks for `.stryke` extension
- Validates JSON structure
- Checks version compatibility
- Handles corrupted files gracefully

### Benefits:

✅ **Work Continuity** - Save and resume projects across sessions  
✅ **Collaboration** - Share complete projects with team members  
✅ **Backup** - Create snapshots before major changes  
✅ **Version Control** - Save multiple versions with timestamps  
✅ **Data Portability** - Move projects between computers  
✅ **Archive** - Keep historical project records  
✅ **Complete State** - Everything saved, nothing lost  
✅ **Easy Workflow** - One click save, one click load  

### User Workflow Examples:

**Scenario 1: Daily Work**
- Monday: Create project, configure facilities → Save
- Tuesday: Load project → Add population data → Save
- Wednesday: Load project → Run simulation → Save results

**Scenario 2: Team Collaboration**
- Engineer A: Sets up facilities and flows → Save project
- Engineer A: Emails `.stryke` file to Engineer B
- Engineer B: Loads project → Adds population data → Save
- Engineer B: Returns updated file to Engineer A

**Scenario 3: Multiple Scenarios**
- Save `baseline_project.stryke`
- Load baseline → Modify flows → Save as `scenario_2.stryke`
- Load baseline → Modify turbines → Save as `scenario_3.stryke`
- Compare results from different scenarios

### File Management:

**File Location:**
- Saved projects go to browser's Downloads folder
- Users can organize files however they want
- Can save to cloud drives (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)

**File Naming:**
```
ProjectName_20250104_143000.stryke
MyDam_20250104_091500.stryke
SmithRiver_Baseline_20250104_140022.stryke
```

**File Size:**
- Typically 10-500 KB depending on project complexity
- Small enough to email
- Fast to save/load

### Error Handling:

**Graceful Failures:**
- Invalid file type → Flash: "Invalid file type. Please upload a .stryke file"
- Corrupted JSON → Flash: "Invalid project file format. File is corrupted..."
- Missing session → Flash: "Session expired. Please log in again."
- Load errors → Flash: "Error loading project: {specific error}"

**User-Friendly Messages:**
- ✅ Success messages with checkmarks
- ⚠️ Warning messages for minor issues
- ❌ Error messages with explanations

### Integration with Existing Features:

**Works With:**
- ✅ Auto-Save (different purpose - auto-save is for crash recovery, project save is for deliberate preservation)
- ✅ Templates (unit params + graph templates for reusable components; full save for complete projects)
- ✅ Validation (save ignores validation, loads restore exact data)

**Auto-Save vs Project Save:**
- **Auto-Save**: Every 3 min, localStorage, crash recovery, temporary
- **Project Save**: Manual, Downloads folder, permanent, shareable

### Testing Checklist:

**Save Project:**
- [ ] Click "Save Project" from home page → should download .stryke file
- [ ] Open .stryke file in text editor → should see valid JSON
- [ ] Check filename includes project name and timestamp
- [ ] Verify all data sections present in JSON

**Load Project:**
- [ ] Click "Load Project" → file picker opens
- [ ] Select .stryke file → should auto-submit
- [ ] Check flash message: "Project loaded successfully"
- [ ] Navigate to each page → all data should be restored
- [ ] Verify flow scenarios, facilities, unit params, graph, population all present

**Error Cases:**
- [ ] Try loading a .txt file → should reject
- [ ] Try loading corrupted JSON → should show error
- [ ] Try saving with no project data → should handle gracefully

**Workflow:**
- [ ] Create new project → Save → Load → Verify data matches
- [ ] Modify loaded project → Save as new file → Compare files
- [ ] Load project → Continue workflow → Run simulation

### Future Enhancements:

**Potential Additions:**
- Project history/versions within file
- Project comparison tool
- Cloud storage integration
- Recent projects list
- Project metadata (author, description, tags)
- Export to other formats (PDF report, Excel)

## Next Steps:

Ready to implement **Feature #5: Progress Indicator for Simulations**

This will show:
- % complete during simulation
- Current day / total days
- Current scenario being processed
- Estimated time remaining
- Enhanced progress bar visualization
