To fit a distribution, simply pass a list of arguments to stryke. The list of arguments, their datatype, and explanations are below.

Stryke fits a Log Normal, Weibull, and Pareto distribution to the returned data and produces a p-value from a Kolmogorov-Smirnof test, where H0 = no difference between observed and simulated histogram.  The distribution with the largest p-value  best describes trends in observed data. The query above produced the figure below.  In this instance, the Log Normal had the highest p-value and is most like the observed data.  For most queries, the Log Normal will be the best distribution.  The Weibull works when there are fewer observations with low rates, and the Pareto only works in special cases when observations are monotonically decreasing after log transforming them. \n",
