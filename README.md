# stryke

Stryke is an Individual Mased Monte Carlo Model that simulates a population of downstream obligated migrating fish as they interact with a theoretical hydroelectric facility.  The simulation employs Monte Carlo methods within an individual based modeling framework.  Meaning we are modeling the individual fates of a theoretical population of fish and summarizing the results for a single simulation.  Then, we iterate that IBM many times and eventually we have a pretty good estimate of what the overall downstream passage survival would be of a theoretical population of fish through a theoretical hydroelectric facility.  

For fish passing via entrainment, individuals are exposed to turbine strike, which is modeled with the Franke et. al. 1997 equations.  For fish that pass via passage structures or spill, mortality is assessed with a roll of the dice using survival metrics determined a priori, sourced from similar studies, or via expert opinion.  The Franke et al. equations calculate the probability a fish of a given length will get struck by a turbine runner blade.  Essentially, if we know how long a given fish is, the velocity of the water as it travels through the turbine, the type of turbine, how many blades and how fast it is rotating, we can calculate with certainty the probability of being struck.  

Fish move through a hydroelectric project where migratory routes are described with a directed acyclic graph.  Fish are obligated downstream migrants.  They can either survive at their current node or they can move to the next one in the graph.  If there is more than one node available at their current location, then a Monte-Carlo role of the dice and a-priori determined transition probabilities control their movement. The simulation ends for a fish when it arrives at the last node in the migratory network or dies.  

Each simulation contains X (user determined) number of fish and is iterated Y (user determined) times.  At the completion of all iterations, stryke describes survival probabilities with a beta distribtion (mean and 95% CI).
