# Session Auto-Save Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Feature #4: Session Recovery/Auto-Save - COMPLETE**

### What Was Implemented:

1. **Auto-Save JavaScript Module** (`webapp/static/autosave.js`)
   - Automatically saves form data every 3 minutes to browser's localStorage
   - Saves on page unload as backup
   - Stores all input fields, textareas, checkboxes, radio buttons, and select dropdowns
   - Does NOT save file inputs or submit buttons

2. **Restore Prompt on Page Load**
   - Detects auto-saved data when user returns
   - Shows attractive modal dialog: "Found auto-saved work from X minutes ago. Would you like to restore it?"
   - Options: ✅ Restore or ❌ Discard
   - Only offers restore if data is less than 24 hours old

3. **Visual Indicators**
   - Fixed bottom-right indicator showing: "💾 Last saved: X minutes ago"
   - Updates every 30 seconds
   - Green border shows active auto-save

4. **Notifications**
   - Success notification when session restored
   - Info notification when session discarded
   - Attractive slide-in animations

5. **Pages Enhanced**
   - ✅ Create Project
   - ✅ Flow Scenarios
   - ✅ Facilities
   - ✅ Unit Parameters
   - ✅ Operating Scenarios
   - ✅ Graph Editor
   - ✅ Population

### Technical Details:

**Storage:**
- Uses browser localStorage (persists across sessions)
- Storage key: `stryke_autosave`
- Timestamp key: `stryke_autosave_timestamp`
- Data format: JSON

**Auto-Save Interval:**
- Every 3 minutes (180,000 milliseconds)
- Also saves on page unload/navigation

**Data Retention:**
- Keeps data for 24 hours
- Automatically clears older data
- Manual clear when user discards

**Public API:**
```javascript
window.StrykeAutoSave.save()     // Manually trigger save
window.StrykeAutoSave.clear()    // Clear auto-saved data
window.StrykeAutoSave.restore()  // Re-check for saved data
```

### How It Works for Users:

1. **Normal Usage:**
   - User fills out forms
   - Every 3 minutes, data automatically saves to browser
   - Bottom-right shows "💾 Last saved: X minutes ago"

2. **Browser Crash / Accidental Close:**
   - When user returns and opens any form page
   - Modal appears: "Found auto-saved work from X minutes ago. Would you like to restore it?"
   - Click "✅ Restore" → All form fields repopulate
   - Click "❌ Discard" → Start fresh, auto-save data cleared

3. **Expiration:**
   - If data is older than 24 hours, automatically discarded (no prompt)

### Benefits:

✅ **Data Protection** - No more lost work from crashes or timeouts  
✅ **User Confidence** - Peace of mind knowing work is saved  
✅ **Zero User Effort** - Completely automatic, no manual saving required  
✅ **Smart Recovery** - Only prompts when relevant (recent data)  
✅ **Non-Intrusive** - Small indicator, doesn't block workflow  
✅ **Cross-Session** - Data persists even after browser closure  

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Fill out Create Project form, wait 3 minutes, refresh page → should prompt to restore
- [ ] Click "Restore" → all fields should repopulate
- [ ] Click "Discard" → should start with empty form
- [ ] Fill out multiple pages, navigate between them → each page saves independently
- [ ] Close browser completely, reopen → should still prompt to restore
- [ ] Check indicator updates every 30 seconds
- [ ] Verify notification animations work
- [ ] Test with various form types (text, checkbox, radio, select, textarea)
