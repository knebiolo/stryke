This module is for working with the five USGS WaterWatch Data Services.
Description of data services https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/webservices/

Main page: https://waterwatch.usgs.gov

NOTICE (taken from waterwatch.usgs.gov): In January 2020, USGS WaterWatch began
operating in maintenance-only mode. Existing tools, features, and web data services are
being fully maintained as before, but new tools and enhancements will no longer be
developed. Please click here for more information or contact USGS WaterWatch if you have
any questions.

The WaterWatch program provides five data services with REST APIs:

- Current Conditions Real-Time Streamflow Service
- Flood and High Flow Service
- Average Streamflow for 7, 14, and 28 Days Service
- Hourly Flow Change Service
- Flood Stage Service

Hydrofunctions allows you to access each of these services as either a dictionary
or a dataframe with the station ID as the key/index.

    This function retrieves a dictionary of flood stages for each site. The 'stage' of
    a river is the height of the river surface at a stream gauge, expressed as a height
    above an arbitrary datum. It is similar to water depth, except that datums are
    usually set so that the zero (0) to be well below the lowest elevation of the
    stream bed. This is done so that even if there is erosion over time, the stream bed
    and the river stage will never reach an elevation that is less than zero. Stage is
    usually expressed in feet in this dataset. You can retrieve the stage of the river
    using the parameter '00065', whereas the discharge of the river is '00060'.

    There are several kinds of flood stage reported in these data:

        * action stage: If the water gets above this level, it triggers an action by
            the National Weather Service.
        * flood stage: Water at this level begins to be a hazard to lives, property, or
            commerce. Not necessarily the same as bankfull stage.
        * moderate flood stage: structures and roads begin to be inundated.
        * major flood stage: requires significant evacuations of people or transfer of
            property to higher elevations.

        See https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/webservices/ for more information.

    Args:
        site (str or list of str):
            The USGS site ID number or a list of numbers.

        output_format: Optional output format. Returns dict if 'dict' else returns pd.DataFrame

    Returns: Dictionary or DataFrame of station numbers and their flood stages. If
        there is no flood stage for a station, `None` is returned.

    Example:
        >>> stations = ["07144100", "07144101"]
